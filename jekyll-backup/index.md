# Turn Any Website Into an RSS Feed

Ever wished you could follow your favorite websites like a social media feed? The html2rss project makes it possible by creating RSS feeds for any website - even ones that don't offer them.

## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) lets you follow websites in your favorite feed reader. Instead of checking multiple websites daily, you get all updates in one place - like a personalized news feed.

## The html2rss Project

The html2rss project provides two main ways to create RSS feeds:

- **html2rss-web** - A user-friendly web application (recommended for most users)
- **html2rss** - A Ruby gem for developers and advanced users

Both use the same powerful engine to extract content from websites and convert it into RSS feeds.
