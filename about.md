# About html2rss

`html2rss` is an open-source project dedicated to empowering users to take control of their web content consumption. In an age where many websites no longer offer traditional RSS feeds, `html2rss` bridges this gap by providing a robust and flexible solution for converting any HTML content into a structured RSS format.

The project was started in 2018 and has since grown into a suite of tools that help users create and consume RSS feeds.
