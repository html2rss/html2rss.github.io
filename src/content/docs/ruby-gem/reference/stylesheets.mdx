The `stylesheets` key allows you to add CSS or XSLT stylesheets to your RSS feed, improving its appearance in web browsers. This makes your RSS feeds look professional and branded when viewed directly in a browser.

## Why Style Your RSS Feed?

Styling your RSS feed provides several benefits:

- **Professional appearance** when viewed in browsers
- **Brand consistency** with your website's design
- **Better user experience** for direct feed access
- **Custom formatting** for different content types

## Configuration

You can add multiple stylesheets to your configuration:

```yaml
stylesheets:
  - href: "/path/to/style.xsl"
    media: "all"
    type: "text/xsl"
  - href: "https://example.com/rss.css"
    media: "all"
    type: "text/css"
```
