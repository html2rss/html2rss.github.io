The `headers` key allows you to set custom HTTP headers for your requests. This is useful for accessing APIs or other protected content.

## Configuration

You can add any number of headers to your configuration:

```yaml
headers:
  User-Agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; html2rss/1.0)"
  Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  Accept: "application/json"
```

## Dynamic Parameters

You can also use dynamic parameters in your headers to pass values at runtime. See [Dynamic Parameters](/ruby-gem/how-to/dynamic-parameters) for more information.
