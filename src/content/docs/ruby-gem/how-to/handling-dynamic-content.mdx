description: "Learn how to handle JavaScript-heavy websites and dynamic content with html2rss. Use browserless strategy for sites that load content dynamically."
---

Some websites load their content dynamically using JavaScript. The default `html2rss` strategy might not see this content.

## Solution

Use the [`browserless` strategy](/ruby-gem/reference/strategy) to render JavaScript-heavy websites with a headless browser.

## When to Use Browserless

The `browserless` strategy is necessary when:

- **Content loads after page load** - JavaScript fetches data from APIs
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** - React, Vue, Angular apps
- **Infinite scroll** - Content loads as you scroll
- **Dynamic forms** - Content changes based on user interaction

## Performance Considerations

The `browserless` strategy is slower than the default `faraday` strategy because it:

- Launches a headless Chrome browser
- Renders the full page with JavaScript
- Takes more memory and CPU resources

**Use `faraday` for static content** and only switch to `browserless` when necessary.
