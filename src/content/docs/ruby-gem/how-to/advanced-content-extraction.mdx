While basic selectors are straightforward, you can achieve very precise content extraction by combining selectors with different extractors and post-processors.

## Extractors

Learn how to extract specific attributes (like `src` for images) or static values. See [Extractors](/ruby-gem/reference/selectors/extractors).

## Post Processors

Manipulate extracted text, sanitize HTML, convert Markdown, or apply custom logic. See [Post Processors](/ruby-gem/reference/selectors/post-processors).
