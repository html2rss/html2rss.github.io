html2rss maintains backward compatibility with older configuration formats and attribute names.

## Renamed Attributes

Some attribute names have been renamed for clarity, but the old names still work:

| Current Name   | Legacy Names         | Description                  |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `published_at` | `updated`, `pubDate` | Publication date of the item |

### Example

Both of these configurations work identically:

```yaml
# Current format (recommended)
selectors:
  published_at:
    selector: ".date"

# Legacy format (still supported)
selectors:
  updated:
    selector: ".date"
```

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from an older version of html2rss:

1. **Update attribute names**: Replace `updated` with `published_at` in your configurations
2. **Test your feeds**: Verify that all feeds still work correctly after the update

## Deprecated Features

The following features are deprecated but still supported:

- **Legacy attribute names**: While still supported, use the current names for new configurations
