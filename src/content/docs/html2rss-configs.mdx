title: Creating Custom RSS Feeds
description: Learn how to create custom RSS feeds using html2rss configuration files
---

Want to create RSS feeds for websites that don't offer them? This guide shows you how to write simple configuration files.

**New to html2rss?** Start with the [web app](/web-application/getting-started) or [browse existing feeds](/feed-directory/) first.

---

## Quick Start

**Need a feed right now?**
1. **[Try the web app](/web-application/getting-started)** - No coding required
2. **[Browse ready-made feeds](/feed-directory/)** - Use what others created
3. **Create a config** - When you need custom control (see below)

**Ready to create a config?** Jump to [Your First Config](#your-first-config).

---

## How It Works

A config file is a simple "recipe" that tells html2rss:
1. **Which website** to look at
2. **What content** to find
3. **How to organize** it into an RSS feed

### The `channel` Block

This tells html2rss basic information about your feed - like giving it a name and telling it which website to look at.

**Example:**
```yaml
channel:
  url: https://example.com/blog
  title: My Awesome Blog
```

This says: "Look at this website and call the feed 'My Awesome Blog'"

### The `selectors` Block

This is where you tell the html2rss engine exactly what to find on the page. You use CSS selectors (like you might use in web design) to point to specific parts of the webpage.

**Example:**
```yaml
selectors:
  items:
    selector: "article.post"
  title:
    selector: "h2 a"
  link:
    selector: "h2 a"
    attribute: href
```

This says: "Find each article, get the title from the h2 anchor, and get the link from the same h2 anchor's href attribute"

**Need more details?** Check our [complete guide to selectors](/ruby-gem/reference/selectors/) for all the options.

## Your First Config

**Step 1:** Look at the website you want to create a feed for. Right-click â†’ "View Page Source" to see the HTML structure.

**Step 2:** Create a file called `example.com.yml` with this basic structure:

```yaml
channel:
  url: https://example.com/blog
  title: My Blog

selectors:
  items:
    selector: "article.post"
  title:
    selector: "h2 a"
  link:
    selector: "h2 a"
    attribute: href
```

**Step 3:** Test it with the [web app](/web-application/) or [Ruby gem](/ruby-gem/installation).

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- **No items found?** Check your selectors with browser tools (F12)
- **Invalid YAML?** Use spaces, not tabs
- **Website not loading?** Check the URL
