---

When ready-made feeds aren't enough, you can write your own configuration files to create custom RSS feeds for any website. This guide shows you how to take full control with YAML configs.

**Prerequisites:** You should be familiar with the [Web Application](/web-application/getting-started) or [Ruby Gem](/ruby-gem/installation) before diving into custom configurations.

---

## When to Use Custom Configs

**Use custom configs when:**

- **Ready-made feeds don't exist** for the website you want to follow
- **Existing feeds are incomplete** or missing important content
- **You need specific formatting** or data extraction
- **The website has complex structure** that requires custom selectors
- **You want to combine data** from multiple sources

**Don't need custom configs?** Check the [Feed Directory](/feed-directory/) first - there might already be a working feed for your website.

---

## Quick Start

**Need a feed right now?**

1. **[Try the web app](/web-application/getting-started)** - No coding required
2. **[Browse ready-made feeds](/feed-directory/)** - Use what others created
3. **Create a config** - When you need custom control (see below)

**Ready to create a config?** Jump to [Your First Config](#your-first-config).

### For html2rss-web Users

If you're using html2rss-web, you can add your config to the `feeds.yml` file:

1. **Find the example** - Check out the [`example` feed config](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/blob/master/config/feeds.yml#L9)
2. **Add your config** to the `feeds.yml` file
3. **Test it** by visiting your html2rss-web instance
4. **Debug** using browser developer tools if needed

---

## How It Works

A config file is a simple "recipe" that tells html2rss:

1. **Which website** to look at
2. **What content** to find
3. **How to organize** it into an RSS feed

### The `channel` Block

This tells html2rss basic information about your feed - like giving it a name and telling it which website to look at.

**Example:**

```yaml
channel:
  url: https://example.com/blog
  title: My Awesome Blog
```

This says: "Look at this website and call the feed 'My Awesome Blog'"

### The `selectors` Block

This is where you tell the html2rss engine exactly what to find on the page. You use CSS selectors (like you might use in web design) to point to specific parts of the webpage.

**Example:**

```yaml
selectors:
  items:
    selector: "article.post"
  title:
    selector: "h2 a"
  link:
    selector: "h2 a"
    attribute: href
```

This says: "Find each article, get the title from the h2 anchor, and get the link from the same h2 anchor's href attribute"

**Need more details?** Check our [complete guide to selectors](/ruby-gem/reference/selectors/) for all the options.

## Configuration Options

html2rss-web supports all the same configuration options as the html2rss Ruby gem:

- **Basic selectors** for title, description, and links
- **Advanced features** like custom headers and dynamic parameters
- **Multiple strategies** for different types of websites
- **Post-processing** to clean up extracted content

---

## Your First Config

**Step 1:** Look at the website you want to create a feed for. Right-click → "View Page Source" to see the HTML structure.

**Step 2:** Create a file called `example.com.yml` with this basic structure:

```yaml
channel:
  url: https://example.com/blog
  title: My Blog

selectors:
  items:
    selector: "article.post"
  title:
    selector: "h2 a"
  link:
    selector: "h2 a"
    attribute: href
```

**Step 3:** Test it with the [web app](/web-application/) or [Ruby gem](/ruby-gem/installation).

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues when writing configs:**

- **No items found?** Check your selectors with browser tools (F12) - the `items.selector` might not match the page structure
- **Invalid YAML?** Use spaces, not tabs, and ensure proper indentation
- **Website not loading?** Check the URL and try accessing it in your browser
- **Missing content?** Some websites load content with JavaScript - you may need to use the `browserless` strategy
- **Wrong data extracted?** Verify your selectors are pointing to the right elements
