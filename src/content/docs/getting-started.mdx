html2rss makes it easy to follow any website through RSS. Use this page as your launchpad and choose the path that matches the amount of control and effort you want.

## Pick Your Path

### Try html2rss instantly

- **Use a hosted instance.** Visit a [community-maintained html2rss-web instance](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/wiki/Instances) and start generating feeds directly in your browserâ€”no installation required.
- **Browse existing feeds.** Our [Feed Directory](/feed-directory/) curates examples you can import into your reader right away.

### Run your own instance

- **Follow the full installation walkthrough.** The [html2rss-web getting started guide](/web-application/getting-started/) covers prerequisites, Docker setup, and first-run checks step by step.
- **Bring your own configuration.** Once your server is up, expand it with the [Creating Custom Feeds](/creating-custom-feeds) guide or explore the [How-to collection](/web-application/how-to/) for common tasks.

### Grow with the community

- **Troubleshoot or ask for help.** Visit the [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/troubleshooting) or join the [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/html2rss/discussions) when you need a hand.
- **Share and collaborate.** Learn how to contribute and self-host with the [Get Involved](/get-involved/) section.

## Next steps

2. Follow the detailed instructions linked above.
