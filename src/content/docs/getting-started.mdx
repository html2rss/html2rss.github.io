Ready to get RSS feeds from any website? Choose your path below. No technical knowledge required!

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Use a Public Instance (Easiest)

**Try html2rss right now:**

1. **Go to a public html2rss instance** (see our [community wiki](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/wiki/Instances) for available instances)
2. **Browse existing feeds** or create auto-sourced feeds from any URL
3. **Copy the RSS URL** and add it to your feed reader
4. **Done!** You're now following the website in your RSS reader

**Perfect for:** Testing, quick feeds, or if you don't want to install anything.

### Option 2: Install Your Own Instance

**For full control and custom feeds:**

1. **Follow the installation steps below**
2. **Create auto-sourced feeds** from any website
3. **Add custom configs** when you need more control
4. **Run your own RSS feed server** with stable HTTPS URLs

**Perfect for:** Power users, custom configurations, or when you need reliability.

## Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up your own copy of html2rss-web on your computer. Don't worry - we'll walk you through every step!

### What You'll Need

- **Docker** - A tool that makes installation simple (like an app store for server software)
- **About 10 minutes** - The whole process is quick and automated

**Don't have Docker?** [Install it first](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) - it's free and works on all major operating systems.

### Step 1: Create a Folder

Create a new folder on your computer to store html2rss-web files:

**Create a new folder** on your computer and name it "html2rss-web". You can do this through your file manager or terminal:

```bash
mkdir html2rss-web
cd html2rss-web
```

### Step 2: Create the Configuration File

Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your new folder. This file tells Docker how to set up html2rss-web with all the features you need.

**How to create the file:**

- **Using a text editor:** Create a new file and save it as `docker-compose.yml`
- **Using terminal:** Use any text editor to create the file

```yaml
services:
  html2rss-web:
    image: gilcreator/html2rss-web:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./feeds.yml
        target: /app/config/feeds.yml
        read_only: true
    environment:
      RACK_ENV: production
      HEALTH_CHECK_USERNAME: health
      HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD: CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD_BEFORE_USE
      BROWSERLESS_IO_WEBSOCKET_URL: ws://browserless:3001
      BROWSERLESS_IO_API_TOKEN: 6R0W53R135510

  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - "~/.docker/config.json:/config.json"
    command: --cleanup --interval 7200

  browserless:
    image: "ghcr.io/browserless/chromium"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3001:3001"
    environment:
      PORT: 3001
      CONCURRENT: 10
      TOKEN: 6R0W53R135510
```

### Step 3: Download the Feed List

html2rss-web needs a list of feeds to work with. Download our pre-made list:

**Download the feeds.yml file:**

- **Using your browser:** Right-click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/master/config/feeds.yml) â†’ Save As â†’ Name it "feeds.yml" â†’ Save in your html2rss-web folder
- **Using terminal:** Open Terminal in your html2rss-web folder and run:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/master/config/feeds.yml -o feeds.yml
```

### Step 4: Start html2rss-web

Now start html2rss-web:

**Start html2rss-web:**

Open a terminal in your html2rss-web folder and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰ html2rss-web is now running.

**To verify it's working:**

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see the html2rss-web interface with a list of available feeds

**If you see the interface, congratulations!** You've successfully set up html2rss-web.

## Using Your Instance

### Browse Existing Feeds

Your html2rss-web instance comes with pre-configured feeds for popular websites. Browse the list and copy any RSS URL to your feed reader.

### Create Auto-Sourced Feeds

**Want a feed for a website that's not in the list?**

1. **Go to your html2rss-web interface** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Enter any website URL** you want to create a feed for
3. **Click "Generate Feed"** - html2rss will automatically analyze the page
4. **Copy the RSS URL** and add it to your feed reader

**This works for most websites** without any configuration needed!

### Add Custom Feeds

**Need more control?** You can add custom feed configurations to your `feeds.yml` file. See our [Creating Custom Feeds](/creating-custom-feeds) guide for details.

## Troubleshooting

**Common issues when getting started:**

- **Instance won't start?** Check that Docker is running and the port isn't already in use
- **Can't access the interface?** Make sure you're going to `http://localhost:3000`
- **Auto-sourced feed not working?** Some websites need custom configuration - see our [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/troubleshooting)
