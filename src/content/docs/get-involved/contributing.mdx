## How to Contribute

Here are the main ways you can contribute to the `html2rss` project:

### 1. Create a Feed Config (Most Popular!)

Are you missing an RSS feed for a website? You can create your own feed config and share it with the community. It's a great way to get started with `html2rss` and help other users.

**The easiest way to contribute:**

1. Go to [html2rss-configs on GitHub](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-configs)
2. Click "Fork" → "Add file" → Create `domain.com.yml`
3. Paste your config → "Commit new file" → "Open pull request"

**Need help writing configs?** See our [Creating Custom Feeds](/creating-custom-feeds) guide.

**Want to test your config first?** Use the [Ruby gem](/ruby-gem/installation) to test it locally:

```bash
html2rss feed your-config.yml
```

### 2. Host a Public Instance

The [`html2rss-web`](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web) project is a web application that provides RSS feeds with stable HTTPS URLs. You can host your own public instance to help other users access feeds.

### 3. Improve the Website

This website is built with Astro and Starlight and is hosted on GitHub Pages. If you have any ideas for improving the documentation or the design, we'd love to hear from you.

[**Find the source code on GitHub**](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss.github.io)

### 4. Improve the `html2rss` Engine

Are you a Ruby developer? You can help us improve the core `html2rss` gem. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving the documentation, your contributions are welcome.

[**Check out the documentation for the `html2rss` Gem**](/ruby-gem/)
