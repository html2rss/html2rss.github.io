## Before You Begin

This guide assumes you already manage a Docker-capable host (VPS, home lab, or Kubernetes node) and are comfortable deploying containers. If you have not yet provisioned a server, complete that prerequisite before proceeding. Review the full [Deployment & Production guide](/web-application/how-to/deployment) for environment sizing, proxy patterns, and step-by-step production hardening.

At a minimum, ensure:

- Docker Engine and Docker Compose Plugin are installed on the host.
- Ports 80/443 (or the ports used by your TLS terminator) are open to the Internet if you plan to serve other users.
- You can publish DNS for your chosen domain.

## Deployment Overview

1. Copy the reference [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and [`config/feeds.yml`](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/blob/master/config/feeds.yml) from the project repository to your deployment directory.
2. Create an `.env` file with production credentials and the values documented in the [environment reference](/web-application/reference/env-variables). Generate new secrets (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and avoid reusing the samples from local testing.
3. Adjust the compose file to match your host (volumes, proxy service, watchtower, resource limits). The [deployment guide](/web-application/how-to/deployment) shows complete examples for Caddy, health-check protection, and automatic updates.
4. Start the stack with `docker compose up -d` and verify the application is reachable at your chosen domain or internal endpoint.

Need extra reliability? Integrate the instance with your existing reverse proxy, DNS, or platform tooling rather than running it ad hoc on a laptop. Treat it like any other production service.

## Harden & Secure

- Follow the [Secure Your Instance](/web-application/how-to/deployment#secure-your-instance) checklist to lock down credentials, TLS, and network access.
- Enforce HTTPS by configuring a reverse proxy (see [Option A: Caddy](/web-application/how-to/deployment#option-a-caddy-automatic-https)) or your preferred terminator. If you manage certificates separately, document the renewal procedure alongside your deployment scripts.
- Review the [security best practices](/web-application/how-to/deployment#prepare-for-production) and keep secrets outside of version control.

## Monitor & Maintain

- Point your uptime monitor at `/health_check.txt` and review container logs regularly. The [Operate & Monitor](/web-application/how-to/deployment#operate-monitor) section outlines suggested thresholds.
- Automate updates with Watchtower or your orchestration tooling to receive the latest html2rss-web releases quickly.
- Track storage usage for feed cache volumes and prune unused images. Schedule periodic configuration reviews so feeds and credentials remain accurate.

## Share Your Instance

Running a reliable deployment benefits the broader community. Add your server to the [community instance list](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/wiki/Instances) once it is stable and you are ready for other readers. Include details such as uptime expectations, moderation policy, and contact information so people know what to expect.
