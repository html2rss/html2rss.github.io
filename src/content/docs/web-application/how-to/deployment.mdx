html2rss-web ships on Docker Hub, so you can launch it wherever Docker runs. Start with the official [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) from the [Installation Guide](/web-application/getting-started) as your baseline.

If you have not yet created a local instance, complete the [Getting Started guide](/web-application/getting-started) first. It walks through the one-time project directory setup, downloading the reference compose file, and confirming the application locallyâ€”steps we will build upon here.

Already running html2rss-web on your workstation? Great! The sections below focus on what changes when you take that setup to production.

## Prepare for Production

Before exposing html2rss-web, ensure:

- Your domain (for example `yourdomain.com`) resolves to the host running Docker
- Inbound TCP ports 80 and 443 reach the host (check firewalls and cloud security groups)
- You are ready to watch the first deployment logs for certificate issuance

### Why a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy accepts public HTTPS traffic, terminates TLS, and forwards requests to html2rss-web running on your private network.

### Option A: Caddy (Automatic HTTPS)

Caddy handles certificates and redirects with almost no configuration.

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - caddy_data:/data
    command:
      - caddy
      - reverse-proxy
      - --from
      - ${CADDY_HOST}
      - --to
      - html2rss:3000
  html2rss:
    image: gilcreator/html2rss-web:latest
    env_file: .env

volumes:
  caddy_data:
```

- Copy the sample env file (`examples/deployment/.env.example`) to `.env` beside your compose file.
- Update your `.env` before starting the stack:
  - Set `CADDY_HOST` and `BASE_URL` for your domain (for example `yourdomain.com` / `https://yourdomain.com`).
  - Generate a production secret (`openssl rand -hex 32`) and assign it to `HTML2RSS_SECRET_KEY`.
  - Replace the sample health-check credentials with strong values.
  - Adjust optional knobs (auto source, Sentry, worker counts) as needed and refer to the [environment reference](/web-application/reference/env-variables) for details.
- After `docker compose up -d`, run `docker compose logs caddy --tail 20`; look for `certificate obtained`.
- Re-test after DNS changes with [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
- Want automatic updates? Add the Watchtower service shown below or reuse the ready-made sample compose file at `examples/deployment/caddy/docker-compose.yml`.

## Secure Your Instance

Harden the application before inviting other users:

- Set strong credentials for health checks and any protected feeds
- Configure `BASE_URL` with the final HTTPS domain before the first public run
- Prefer environment files (`.env`) stored outside version control for secrets
- Keep admin-only routes behind basic auth or IP restrictions in your proxy

```yaml
services:
  html2rss:
    image: gilcreator/html2rss-web:latest
    environment:
      RACK_ENV: production
      LOG_LEVEL: warn
      HEALTH_CHECK_USERNAME: your-secure-username
      HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD: your-very-secure-password
      BASE_URL: https://yourdomain.com
```

Store these variables in a `.env` file and reference it with `env_file:` as demonstrated in the Caddy example.

## Operate & Monitor

Keep the instance healthy once it is in production:

- Monitor `https://yourdomain.com/health_check.txt` from your uptime tool
- Review `docker compose logs` regularly for feed errors or certificate renewals
- Enable automatic image updates so security patches roll out quickly
- Right-size CPU and memory to avoid starvation when parsing large feeds

### Auto-update with Watchtower

```yaml
services:
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    depends_on:
      - html2rss
      - caddy
    command:
      - --cleanup
      - --interval
      - "300"
      - html2rss
      - caddy
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Check `docker compose logs watchtower` occasionally to confirm updates are applied.

### Resource Guardrails

```yaml
services:
  html2rss:
    image: gilcreator/html2rss-web:latest
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
          cpus: "0.5"
        reservations:
          memory: 256M
          cpus: "0.25"
```

Adjust the limits to match your host capacity. Increase memory if you process many large feeds.

## Share & Support

- Test different feed sources before inviting external users
- Add your instance to the [community wiki](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/wiki/Instances) if you want it listed publicly
- Visit the [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/troubleshooting) or join the [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/html2rss/discussions) when you need help
