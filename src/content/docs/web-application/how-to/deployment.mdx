html2rss-web is published on Docker Hub, making it easy to deploy with Docker. The `docker-compose.yml` from our [Installation Guide](/web-application/getting-started) provides a solid foundation for both development and production use.

## Quick Start

If you've already set up html2rss-web locally, you're ready to deploy it to production. The same Docker configuration works for both environments.

## Production Best Practices

When hosting a **public instance** that others will use, please follow these essential guidelines:

### Security Essentials

- **Use a reverse proxy** (nginx, Apache, or Cloudflare) to handle SSL termination and rate limiting
- **Enable HTTPS only** - redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- **Set strong passwords** for health check and auto-source authentication
- **Restrict access** to admin endpoints and sensitive configuration

### Reliability & Monitoring

- **Enable auto-updates** using watchtower or similar tools
- **Monitor the health check endpoint** (`/health_check.txt`) to detect issues early
- **Set up logging** to track errors and performance
- **Use environment variables** for configuration instead of hardcoded values

### Performance Optimization

- **Configure appropriate resource limits** for your Docker containers
- **Use a CDN** for static assets if serving many users
- **Monitor memory usage** - html2rss-web can be memory-intensive with large feeds
- **Set up caching** for frequently accessed feeds

## Environment Configuration

For production, update your environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  RACK_ENV: production
  LOG_LEVEL: warn
  HEALTH_CHECK_USERNAME: your-secure-username
  HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD: your-very-secure-password
  BASE_URL: https://your-domain.com
```

## Share Your Instance

Once your instance is running smoothly:

- **[Add it to our community wiki](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/wiki/Instances)** so others can discover it
- **Test thoroughly** with various feed types before sharing
- **Monitor usage** and be prepared to scale if needed
