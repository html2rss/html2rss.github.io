html2rss-web is published on Docker Hub, making it easy to deploy with Docker. The [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) from our [Installation Guide](/web-application/getting-started) provides a solid foundation for both development and production use.

## Quick Start

1. Create a directory for your instance:
   ```bash
   mkdir html2rss-web && cd html2rss-web
   ```
2. Download the configuration:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/master/docker-compose.yml
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/master/config/feeds.yml
   ```
3. Start the instance:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to verify itâ€™s running.

## Production Best Practices

When hosting a **public instance** that others will use, please follow these essential guidelines:

### Security

- **Use a reverse proxy** ([nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/), Apache, or Cloudflare) to handle SSL termination and rate limiting
- **Enable HTTPS only** â€” redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS ([certbot guide](https://certbot.eff.org/))
- **Set strong passwords** for health check and auto-source authentication
- **Restrict access** to admin endpoints and sensitive configuration

### HTTPS

Setting up HTTPS is crucial for any public instance. Follow these steps:

1. **Obtain SSL certificates** using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
2. **Configure your reverse proxy** to handle SSL termination
3. **Redirect all HTTP traffic** to HTTPS automatically
4. **Test your setup** using tools like [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)

For detailed implementation guides, see:
- [Nginx SSL configuration](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/terminating-ssl-http/)
- [Apache SSL setup](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html)
- [Cloudflare SSL/TLS settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/)

### Reliability & Monitoring

- **Enable auto-updates** using [watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) or similar tools
- **Monitor the health check endpoint** (`/health_check.txt`) to detect issues early
- **Set up logging** to track errors and performance
- **Use environment variables** for configuration instead of hardcoded values

### Performance Optimization

- **Configure appropriate resource limits** for your Docker containers
- **Use a CDN** for static assets if serving many users
- **Monitor memory usage** â€” html2rss-web can be memory-intensive with large feeds
- **Set up caching** for frequently accessed feeds

## Environment Configuration

For production, update your environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  RACK_ENV: production
  LOG_LEVEL: warn
  HEALTH_CHECK_USERNAME: your-secure-username
  HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD: your-very-secure-password
  BASE_URL: https://your-domain.com
```

Use a [password manager](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/) to generate strong values.

## Share Your Instance

Once your instance is running smoothly:

- **[Add it to our community wiki](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/wiki/Instances)** so others can discover it
- **Test thoroughly** with various feed types before sharing
- **Monitor usage** and be prepared to scale if needed
