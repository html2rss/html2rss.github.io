html2rss-web comes with hundreds of ready-made feeds for popular websites! No configuration needed - just use the URLs.

## How to Use Them

1. **Find a feed** in the [Feed Directory](/feed-directory/)
2. **Copy the URL** (it looks like `domainname.tld/whatever.rss`)
3. **Add it to your feed reader** - paste the URL and you're done!

## Example

If you see a config file named `example.com/news.yml`, you can access it at:
`http://localhost:3000/example.com/news.rss`

Just replace `localhost:3000` with your html2rss-web address.
