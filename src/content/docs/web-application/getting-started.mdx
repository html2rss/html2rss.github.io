# Getting Started with html2rss-web

Welcome! This guide will help you create RSS feeds from any website using the html2rss-web application.

## What is html2rss-web?

html2rss-web is a user-friendly web application that turns any website into an RSS feed. It's part of the html2rss project, which also includes a Ruby gem for developers. Think of html2rss-web as a translator that converts website content into a format your feed reader can understand.

## Why Use RSS Feeds?

Instead of visiting 20 different websites every day, you can:

- **Get all updates in one place** - your feed reader
- **Never miss new content** - automatic notifications
- **Save time** - no more manual checking
- **Stay organized** - categorize and filter content

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Browse Ready-Made Feeds (Easiest)

1. **[Feed Directory](/feed-directory/)** - See what's already available
2. **Copy the RSS URL** and add it to your feed reader

### Option 2: Install Your Own Instance

1. **[Installation Guide](/web-application/installation)** - Set up your own copy
2. **[Create Custom Feeds](/web-application/how-to/)** - Make feeds for any website

**New to RSS?** We recommend starting with the [Feed Directory](/feed-directory/) to see examples, then installing html2rss-web to create your own feeds.
