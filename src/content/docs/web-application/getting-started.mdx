## Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up your own copy of html2rss-web on your computer. Don't worry - we'll walk you through every step!

### What You'll Need

- **Docker** - A tool that makes installation simple (like an app store for server software)
- **About 10 minutes** - The whole process is quick and automated

**Don't have Docker?** [Install it first](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) - it's free and works on all major operating systems.

### Step 1: Create a Folder

Create a new folder on your computer to store html2rss-web files:

**Create a new folder** on your computer and name it "html2rss-web". You can do this through your file manager or terminal:

```bash
mkdir html2rss-web
cd html2rss-web
```

### Step 2: Create the Configuration File

Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your new folder. This file tells Docker how to set up html2rss-web with all the features you need.

**How to create the file:**

- **Using a text editor:** Create a new file and save it as `docker-compose.yml`
- **Using terminal:** Use any text editor to create the file

```yaml
services:
  html2rss-web:
    image: gilcreator/html2rss-web
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./feeds.yml
        target: /app/config/feeds.yml
        read_only: true
    environment:
      RACK_ENV: production

      BROWSERLESS_IO_WEBSOCKET_URL: ws://browserless:3001
      BROWSERLESS_IO_API_TOKEN: 6R0W53R135510

  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - "~/.docker/config.json:/config.json"
    command: --cleanup --interval 7200

  browserless:
    image: "ghcr.io/browserless/chromium"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3001:3001"
    environment:
      PORT: 3001
      CONCURRENT: 10
