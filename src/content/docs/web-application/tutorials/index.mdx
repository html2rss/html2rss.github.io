Welcome to the tutorial hub for the html2rss web application. Each guide is written for curious feed builders who prefer a walkthrough over reference docs.

## Who these tutorials are for

If you are experimenting with html2rss-web for the first time, the tutorials will help you:

- Understand how the interface pieces fit together.
- Practice building feeds from real-world sites.
- Learn how to iterate safely without impacting production feeds.

Already comfortable with the basics? Use the tutorials as a refresher before trying more advanced automation in the [How-to guides](/web-application/how-to/) and [Reference docs](/web-application/reference/).

## What to expect next

We are actively drafting scenario-based lessons that cover topics such as:

1. Publishing your first feed from a news site.
2. Monitoring marketplace listings with filters.
3. Sharing a feed with teammates using private instances.

Check back soonâ€”new tutorials will appear in this section automatically as they are published.
