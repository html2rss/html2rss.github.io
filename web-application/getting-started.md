# Getting Started with the html2rss Web Application

Welcome to the `html2rss-web` application! This guide provides a strategic overview to help you understand what the application does and how to get started.

## What is html2rss-web?

`html2rss-web` is a self-hosted web application that scrapes content from websites and converts it into RSS feeds. It's designed for users who want to create reliable, custom RSS feeds for sites that don't offer them.

## Primary Use Cases

- **Create RSS feeds** for your favorite blogs, news sites, or any website with structured content.
- **Monitor website changes** by subscribing to the generated RSS feeds.
- **Aggregate content** from multiple sources into your feed reader.

## The Path to Your First Feed

Here's the recommended path for a new user:

1.  **[Installation]({{ '/web-application/installation' | relative_url }})**: Follow our step-by-step guide to set up your own instance of the application using Docker. This is the quickest and most reliable way to get started.

If you're interested in more advanced topics, you can explore our **[How-To Guides]({{ '/web-application/how-to/' | relative_url }})** and the **[Reference]({{ '/web-application/reference/' | relative_url }})** section after you have your instance up and running.
