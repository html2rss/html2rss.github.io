# html2rss-web

This web application scrapes websites to build and deliver RSS 2.0 feeds. ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web))

## Features

- **Stable URLs:** Provides stable URLs for feeds generated by automatic sourcing.

- **Caching:** Handles request caching and sets caching-related HTTP headers.

The functionality of scraping websites and building the RSS feeds is provided by the Ruby gem [`html2rss`](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss).

For the latest commit passing GitHub CI/CD on the master branch, an updated Docker image will be pushed to [Docker Hub: `gilcreator/html2rss-web`](https://hub.docker.com/r/gilcreator/html2rss-web).
