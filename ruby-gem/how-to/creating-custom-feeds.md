# Creating Your First Custom Feed

To build your own RSS feed, you need to create a _feed config_. That _feed config_ goes into the file `feeds.yml`.

Check out the [`example` feed config](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss-web/blob/master/config/feeds.yml#L9).

Please refer to [html2rss' README for a description of the feed config and its options](https://github.com/html2rss/html2rss#the-feed-config-and-its-options). html2rss-web is just a small web application that builds on html2rss.
